    ">\"in many industries, low prices are associated with low sales. For example, in the hotel industry, prices are low outside the tourist season, and prices are high when demand is highest and hotels are full. Given that data, a naive prediction might suggest that increasing the price would lead to more rooms sold.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Most data scientists know a lot of ML and not much causal inference; this leads to an abundance of ML models being deployed where they are not useful for the task at hand. Think of ML as a toolbox, not as prediction as the solution to all things. \n",
